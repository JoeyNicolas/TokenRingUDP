# Challenge 1:

display filter: http.request.method == "POST"

Because we are Students, and the lecture focuses on Internet and protocols, 
a HTTP POST request to login was simple enough for the hint "password".

This filter only returned a single result.
in the Payload is a json object of a Members login credential
The password object being 8 characters long, only lowercase and numbers

String value: dzh20szq

# Challenge 2:
Now the second Challenge should be a modified display filter to check HTTP error transmissions

since the response.code of a sucessful HTTP request is 200,
display filter: http.response.code !=200
returns 6 Packets:
{1x 371, 3x 372, 1x 302, 1x 401}
Since a http.response.code of 404 is close to 401 this has to be the Packet I was looking for.
Response Phrase: ra6rgv7h  

# Challenge 3:

clue= "Hiddeninping"
maybe filtering for "ping packets"?

Okay I have no idea how but I didn't use any display filter, I just clicked on the column 'length'.
First Packet has "Echo (ping) request" written in the infor column...

ICMP = "Internet Control Message Protocol"
Type: 8 (Echo (ping) request)
...
Data (8 bytes):
    Data: "6e64376861726b33"
    *left click on that highlights the 8 character long lowercase and numbers String in the 'packet bytes box'
    right clicking on "6e64376861726b33" -> copy as printable text gives me the desired 8 length sized String:
    "nd7hark3"

The final solution code is = "Q29uZ3JhdHNfVGhpc19Jc190aGVfQm9udXMh"

a quick python programm to test different encodings resulted in:

import base64
text = 'Q29uZ3JhdHNfVGhpc19Jc190aGVfQm9udXMh'
decoded_text = base64.b64decode(text).decode('utf-8')
print(decoded_text)

returns: "Congrats_This_Is_the_Bonus!"
